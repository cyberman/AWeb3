# Contributing

This project is based on AWeb, which is licensed under the [AWeb Public License](./LICENSE.md). To keep contributions legally clear and consistent, please read the following before submitting code.

## Licensing and Copyright

- By submitting a pull request, you agree that your contribution is licensed under the AWeb Public License (APL).  
- **Contributions** of any size - large (new features, modules, significant bug fixes) or small (e.g. typo fixes, formatting, trivial refactors, one-liner changes):
  - Are considered *de minimis* and do not carry independent copyright.  
  - Are contributed on a no-rights-reserved basis (equivalent to public domain).  
  - Will not be listed in copyright notices.  

- Do **not** submit code you do not have the right to contribute. In particular:
  - **Copyleft code (GPL, LGPL, AGPL, etc.)**:  
    - Cannot be merged directly into the APL-licensed codebase.  
    - May only be accepted if it is **cleanly partitioned** (e.g. an optional plugin, external submodule, or separately distributed component) and approved by maintainers.  
    - Such components must be clearly marked with their own license file and integration boundaries.  
  - All other contributions must be compatible with the APL license. If in doubt, open an issue before submitting.  

## Contribution Process

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.  
2. Make your changes, with clear and maintainable code.  
3. Add or update tests and documentation if applicable.  
4. Ensure all builds/tests pass locally.  
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of the changes and why they are valuable.  

## Code Review

- All contributions will be reviewed by project maintainers.  
- We may request changes (tests, documentation, style) before merging.  
- Maintainers have final discretion on what is merged.
