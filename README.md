# AWeb 3

This is AWeb 3 APL open source version, an HTML 3/4 web browser for Amiga.

## [amigazen project](http://www.amigazen.com)

*A web, suddenly*

*Forty years meditation*

*Minds awaken, free*

**amigazen project** is using modern software development tools and methods to update and rerelease classic Amiga open source software. Projects include a new AWeb, a new Amiga Python 2, and the ToolKit project - a universal SDK for Amiga.

Key to the amigazen project approach is ensuring every project can be built with the same common set of development tools and configurations, so the ToolKit project was created to provide a standard configuration for Amiga development. All *amigazen project* releases will be guaranteed to build against the ToolKit standard so that anyone can download and begin contributing straightaway without having to tailor the toolchain for their own setup.

The original authors of the *AWeb* software are not affiliated with the amigazen project. This software is redistributed on terms described in the documentation, particularly the file LICENSE or LICENSE.md

The amigazen project philosophy philosophy is based on openness:

*Open* to anyone and everyone	- *Open* source and free for all	- *Open* your mind and create!

PRs for all projects are gratefully received at [GitHub](https://github.com/amigazen/). While the focus now is on classic 68k software, it is intended that all amigazen project releases can be ported to other Amiga-like systems including AROS and MorphOS where feasible.

## About AWeb 3

AWeb is one of the most sophisticated web browsers (for its time) ever released on the Amiga platform. The original author, Yvon Rozijn, kindly made AWeb open source under the AWeb Public License. 

This project's first aim is to update the code so it builds against the NDK3.2, which largely means replacing the ClassAct UI APIs with the equivalent ReAction versions, as well as updating the networking code to work properly with RoadShow and the latest AmiSSL, and ensuring it can be built easily out of the box against the ToolKit standard by anyone with an Amiga computer.

## HTML Standards Support

AWeb 3 supports HTML standards from the 1990s era web browsing. The browser implements:

- **HTML 2.0**: Full support for the official HTML 2.0 standard
- **HTML 3.2**: Full support (W3C Recommendation from 1996)
- **HTML 4.0**: Many features supported, including experimental CSS1/CSS2 subset via inline styles and external stylesheets
- **XHTML 1.0/1.1**: Support for parsing and rendering XHTML 1.0/1.1 (and XHTML-MP) in strict mode with CDATA and self-closing tags (experimental)

AWeb also supports many browser-specific extensions from Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer of the era, as well as some features from the abandoned HTML 3.0 draft.

## Roadmap

The first AWeb APL open source release was version 3.4, in 2003 from the _AWeb Open Source Development Team_.

Since then one further "3.5" beta release - or rather, 12 beta releases of 3.5 - were made for both OS4 and classic Amiga, and even MorphOS and AROS too, however the sourcecode to the 68k release of 3.5 seems to no longer be available to the public in a buildable form, if it ever was with dependencies on a very specific, and undocumented, GCC based toolchain. Snapshots for versions for other platforms such as OS4 can be found, such as on os4depot, but the developers of 3.5 did not seem to bother to maintain compatibility with the classic Amiga build tools used by the original AWeb.

Thus, this version 3.6 is derived directly from the 3.4 source code release, with the intent to cherry-pick improvements from the 3.5 branch where the changes have added value. 

The roadmap for AWeb under amigazen project is, for now:

### AWeb 3.6

The first release from amigazen project is version 3.6. The goals of this release are simply:

- Ensure AWeb can be built with supported SDKs
- Set sensible default prefs based on conventions that emerged in the years since AWeb was still state of the art
- Package both binary and sourcecode releases properly for ease of distribution and installation 
- Refactor the HTTP and SSL code to work better with modern web servers using HTTP/1.1, gzip, chunked encoding and modern TLS using AmiSSL

The main changes in version 3.6 compared to version 3.4 are:
- Stable re-release of AWeb 3.4 functionality built against support SDKs i.e. ReAction, Roadshow (with INet225 support disabled), P96 (replacing no longer supported Cybergraphics libraries), AmiSSL 5.2 and NDK3.2
- Adding HTTP/1.1, chunked encoding and gzip compressed http streams support with a refactored http module
- Renamed the application to simply _AWeb_, not AWeb-II or AWeb3, just _AWeb_ and the assign is also now just _AWeb:_ and will be automatically created on launch if it does not already exist
- Refactoring the SSL module code to stabilise it and update it to use AmiSSL 5.20 or later
- Changing default configuration settings to sensible values including white default background, Cookies accepted by default, and scalable fonts

**What's New in 3.6 Alpha 6:**
- **Enhanced CSS Support:** More CSS properties including padding, margin (with auto), position, borders, vertical-align, text-align, display: none, overflow clipping, clear for floats, and min/max width/height constraints. CSS colors can be specified in hex or by name

- **MIME Type Handling:** Enhanced content-type detection and support for recognising RSS/Atom feeds (rendered as plain text)

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for complete details of all changes.




## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is the ultimate aim of the new AWeb project?

The Amiga actually had one of the first graphical web browsers - AMosaic reimplemented Mosaic natively for Amiga using MUI, and came out not long after the Mac and Windows versions of Mosaic. This was later followed by IBrowse, Voyager and AWeb itself. A browser called Web Cruiser was announced by Finale Development, the team behind ClassAct, but was quickly cancelled as it became clear the Amiga platform would no longer be commercially viable.

Of these, the closest thing to a browser integrating tightly into the Amiga operating system is AWeb, due to its use of the ClassAct, now ReAction, user interface toolkit, as well as DataTypes, ARexx and extending the Amiga's BOOPSI and shared library architecture for its own plugin system. 

When AWeb was originally developed, web standards were in a state of rapid flux and many websites relied on plugin technologies such as Shockwave Flash and Java Applets, making it a challenge for any browser developer to keep up let alone one working on their own. Ironically in 2025 the needs of a 'classic web browser' are lesser as both Flash and Applets have died off completely, although modern browsers employ a variety of new standards to provide similar capabilities for interactive 'web apps'.

The release of AWeb as open source was a generous act by its author, and the code itself a masterpiece of software design, one that deserves continued effort to "finish the job" started all those years ago.

In this context, finishing the job means both completing support for the final versions of those web standards and, with the benefit of hindsight, the way those features ended up being used in practice. It also means leveraging the AWeb architecture in new ways to extend the Amiga platform to provide reusable services such as HTML rendering and HTTP processing in a way that other platforms have enjoyed in the intervening years and true to the Amiga platform's famous modularity.

### Which features from the various releases of AWeb 3.5 have already been cherry-picked for inclusion in AWeb 3.6?

The following features from AWeb 3.5 have been reintegrated in **AWeb 3.6**:
- Correct handling of caching or not-caching HTTP redirect (30x) responses
- Correct use of GetBitMapAttrs() instead of direct access of private layers.library structures - this prevents graphics corruption on OS4 on pages with background images for example
- A fix for a bug where empty JavaScript files were still cached unnecessarily
- The image format AWebPlugins have been updated to the slightly more recent versions found in AWeb 3.5, and then in fact updated further to the latest version in the case of PNG
- ETags support in the cache
- Enhanced handling of 302 and 307 redirects 
- Dynamic Garbage Collection of temporary objects in the JavaScript engine to reduce memory usage
- Parsing of Content-Disposition headers to suggest filenames for saved downloads
- All of the JavaScript enhancements bringing AWeb close to ECMAScript 3 compliance have been integrated and further enhanced
- Mousewheel support for OS4
- Copy image URL to clipboard is added to the popup menu
- INS and DEL tags are recognised and rendered appropriately
- INPUT and BUTTON form elements can exist outside of forms and be used with JavaScript events
- Saved files will get a DefIcons provided icon image
- 24-bit printing is available also with printer.device v44 or later, not just with TurboPrint
- The enhancements to the gopher module that "finish" AWeb's implementation of the gopher protocol are all incorporated

### Are there any features from the various releases of AWeb 3.5 that are not going to be reintegrated into AWeb 3.6?

The implementation of HTTP/1.1, gzip and chunked encoding, as well as new features such as HTTP Range and keep-alive support, in AWeb 3.6 is vastly more sophisticated than the simplistic version in AWeb 3.5, it is an all new implementation, so no code from the AWeb 3.5 version has been reintegrated. Similarly the AmiSSL 5 integration is all new.

3.5 had incomplete changes laying the groundwork for future utf-8 support, as well as the external Charset plugin that did provide a more comprehensive solution built on codesets.library. 3.6 already has more complete builtin utf-8 support in the parser that will cope with the most common 2 and 3 byte character to Latin1 encodings. 

Other changes from AWeb 3.5 that have been reviewed and rejected are:
- FTP module changes were integrated, tested, and found to be completely broken. Rather than fix the AWeb 3.5 code, which made unnecessary changes to otherwise already working code, the changes were reverted out completely. AWeb's original FTP module already worked correctly.
- Support for multiple MIME entries for a given mime type was a kludge for a server side issue rarely encountered, and complicated the UI unnecessarily
- New About dialog (erroneously called splash screen in the AWeb 3.5 documentation) was overcomplicated and ugly, AWeb 3.6 keeps the original AWeb 3.4 About dialog
- Plugin API and version numbering was changed unnecessarily in AWeb 3.5. AWeb 3.6 Plugin API remains consistent with AWeb 3.4
- Borders around images was made a user configurable setting with additional AWebCfg settings. This is both unnecessary - images should simply not have borders unless styled as such - and rendered it necessary to localise the new settings
- Double buffering implementation was found to cause many regressions and removed from the AWeb 3.6 code after testing. This topic will be looked at again in the future

As of AWeb 3.6 Alpha 7 the only significant remaining differences between AWeb 3.5 and AWeb 3.6 are the user interface layout changes and configuration settings

### What is amigazen project's plan for the future of AWeb?

The first release 3.6 is designed to be a stable rebuild of version 3.4 updated to build with the latest NDK and relevant third party SDKs such as AmiSSL 5 and RoadShow, still also using SAS/C like the original release. The most important changes from the various beta releases of 3.5 will also be cherry picked for inclusion where they don't break compatibility with classic Amiga.

Later releases will then add new features missing from AWeb's standards support incrementally.

The intention will be to eventually reach a version of AWeb that implements at least some of CSS including CSS2, HTML standards up to XHTML and XMLHttpRequest() in JavaScript, with a DOM, which should give AWeb compatibility up to the equivalent of about 2008 to 2010 era web content, though this may mean by the time the work is finished it is almost an entirely new web browser...

### Does the new AWeb work on Workbench 3.1, 3.5 or 3.9?

The new AWeb is built and tested using the NDK 3.2 but should still be compatible with Workbench 3.1 with ClassAct, or the 3.5 and 3.9 releases with ReAction. Likewise the network support is built with the Roadshow SDK but should work with any bsdsocket.library implementation, and is most heavily tested with the UAE version for obvious reasons.

New features such as system settings for contextual mouse pointers are implemented in progressive upgrade way at runtime wherever possible, for example with branching code paths that check if intuition.library 47 or higher is available.

### Will AWeb support modern websites?

Since the advent of HTML5, CSS3, WebAssembly, WebGL and more new web technologies, the browser has become an operating system unto itself. Indeed, many popular applications are these days written to use the Electron runtime, built on Chromium and Blink and are thus hybrid web apps, not truly native apps. This is why there are really only 3 browser engines left - WebKit as supported by Apple, Blink, originally forked from WebKit and used in Chromium which is the foundation of most current web browsers from Google Chrome itself to Microsoft Edge and new browsers from AI startups, and the venerable Gecko used by Firefox, now in its new Rust based iteration. 

Some legacy forks remain such as the Goanna continuation of the original C based Gecko code, but the sheer cost involved in maintaining a browser engine in 2025 means no it's not realistic to expect AWeb can support these features on any platform let alone on classic Amiga with its legacy constraints.

### What happened to the AWeb Open Source Development Team?

No idea, but their website at aweb.sunsite.dk has been deactivated since 2009 and their sourcecode only available in snapshots across various Amiga file libraries, in fact they seem to have frequently done their work not in compliance with the AWeb Public License. Some of their members remain active on other Amiga development projects mostly for OS4. It is now the year 2025. Some of their content, such as their ticket boards, can still be viewed on archive.org including a tentative plan for an AWeb 4 based on KHTML - the very same engine that later became WebKit - but it seems the sourcecode repository for any of their versions was never public or has been lost to history.

### Will this new version of AWeb be available for OS4, AROS or MorphOS?

Ports of AWeb - version 3.5 - already exist, so at some point it should be possible to re-merge the platform specific changes in. Unfortunately most of the work done on the 3.5 beta releases made no effort to retain compatibility with a native Amiga classic builds, so this new release starts again updating from the original 3.4 release from Yvon Rozijn.

The first priority however is to get a good, stable build of AWeb in the form Yvon left it in when he gave it to the community.

The current AWeb 3.6 Alpha 4 runs on OS4 as a 68k binary, however as a native 68k binary it cannot utilise the PowerPC native AmiSSL library and therefore https connections will not work. Note that there are some known OS4-specific issues documented in the release notes.

### Can I contribute to the new AWeb?

Yes please! Whether code, testing or translations and documentation, all contributions are welcome and will remain free and open source in the spirit and letter of the AWeb Public License. See also (CONTRIBUTING.md)
