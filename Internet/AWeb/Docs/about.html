<h1><img src=aweb.iff alt=(logo) width=192 height=93>&nbsp; About Pages</h1>

AWeb supports special internal URLs using the "<code><b>about:</b></code>" protocol
scheme. These pages provide browser information, utilities, and special pages
similar to those found in other web browsers. You can use these URLs in your
hotlist, bookmarks, or as links in web pages.
<p>
Note that these URLs are specific to AWeb and may not be recognized by other
browsers.

<h2>Browser Information</h2>
<dl>
<dt><code><b>about:</b></code> or <code><b>about:version</b></code>
<dd>Displays information about AWeb, including version details, supported web
   standards, license information, and third-party component acknowledgements.
   This page provides comprehensive information about the browser and its
   capabilities.
<p>
<dt><code><b>about:blank</b></code>
<dd>Displays a blank page. This is useful for creating empty pages or as a
   default target for links. The page contains minimal HTML structure but
   no visible content.
</dl>

<h2>Utility Pages</h2>
<dl>
<dt><code><b>about:home</b></code>
<dd>AWeb's default home page featuring a search interface powered by BoingSearch
   and quick links to commonly used resources. This page can be set as your
   browser's home page in the preferences, or accessed directly via this URL.
   The page includes links to AWeb documentation and Amiga resources.
<p>
<dt><code><b>about:fonts</b></code>
<dd>A comprehensive font test page that displays how different font families,
   sizes, and styles render in AWeb. This page is useful for:
   <ul>
   <li>Testing how fonts appear with your installed font set
   <li>Viewing font rendering for serif, sans-serif, and monospace families
   <li>Comparing different font sizes and styles
   <li>Checking special character rendering
   </ul>
   The page includes sample text using classical Japanese haiku to demonstrate
   text flow and readability.
</dl>

<h2>Usage Examples</h2>
You can use these URLs in various ways:
<ul>
<li>Set <code>about:home</code> as your browser's home page in the
    <a href=settings/nwoptions.html#home>network options</a>.
<li>Add <code>about:</code> to your hotlist to quickly access browser
    information.
<li>Use <code>about:blank</code> as a target for links that should open
    in a new window without loading content.
<li>Bookmark <code>about:fonts</code> for quick access to the font test page.
</ul>

<h2>Technical Details</h2>
The <code>about:</code> protocol is implemented as a plugin (<code>about.aweblib</code>). If you do not need the about: URLs you can remove the about.aweblib plugin.
