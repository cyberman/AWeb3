<h1>ReAction</h1>
<strong>AWeb uses the ReAction (formerly ClassAct) GUI toolkit.</strong>
<p>
ReAction is a set of BOOPSI gadget and image classes, designed to speed
up and simplify the development of GUI applications. 

ReAction is integrated into all modern version of the Amiga operating system software. 
Alternatively, users of older versions can use the original ClassAct available 
from Aminet <a href="https://www.aminet.net/dev/gui/classact33.lha">https://www.aminet.net/dev/gui/classact33.lha</a>
