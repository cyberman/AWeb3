<h1><img src=aweb.iff width=192 height=93 alt=(logo)>&nbsp; System requirements</h1>

AWeb needs the following to run:
<ul>
<li>AWeb is built against the NDK 3.2 but should work on Workbench 3.1 (with ClassAct), and 3.5 and 3.9 with ReAction as well, but compatibility has not been tested. 
<p>
<li>At least 3 MB of memory as an absolute minimum. 8 MB or more is highly recommended.
<p>
<li>AmiTCP/IP or compatible TCP stack to access the World Wide Web. RoadShow and UAE bsdsocket.library are tested and recommended. Other stacks like Miami and TermiteTCP may work but are not tested.<br>
<small><i>Note: INet225 and AS225 are deprecated and no longer supported.</i></small>
<p>
<li>Unlike earlier distributions of AWeb, image format plugins are now included in the distribution.</a>.
<p>
<li>To hear background sounds on pages, a WAV and an AU datatype are recommended.
Instead of sound datatypes, you may want to use an external player like <code>Play16</code>.
For MIDI background sounds, a MIDI player (like <code>GMPlay</code>) is recommended.
<p>
<li>For 24-bit graphics support, P96 (Picasso96) is required.<br>
<small><i>Note: CyberGraphics is deprecated and no longer supported.</i></small>
</ul>
