This is AWeb 3.6, a new release of the classic AWeb for the Amiga from <a href="http://amigazen.com/">amigazen project</a>. This release is AWeb 3.6 Alpha 7, a preview release intended for testing and feedback. The full source code of this release is available at https://github.com/amigazen/aweb3/ - this link is not clickable as AWeb will not be able to cope with the github website!
</p>

<p>
<b>amigazen project</b> uses modern software development tools and methods to update and rerelease classic Amiga open source software. This release updates AWeb to build against NDK3.2, replacing ClassAct with ReAction, updating networking code for RoadShow and AmiSSL, and ensuring it builds against the amigazen project ToolKit standard.
</p>

<h4>Read this first</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Alpha release</b> This is an unstable Alpha release with many known and unknown issues, please report issues at Github</li>
		<li><b>AWeb 3.5</b> This AWeb 3.6 is derived directly from AWeb 3.4, with improvements from AWeb 3.5 being integrated one by one. See the full release notes to see which features are already integrated</li> 
		<li>This means configurations and catalogs from AWeb 3.4 are compatible but AWeb 3.5 configurations and catalogs are not.</li>
		<li>Even if you have a preferred AWeb 3.4 configuration, note that the references to AWebPath: should be changed to AWeb: in your configuration. Since there are many new default preferences in AWeb 3.6, starting from a clean configuration is recommended.</li>
		<li>You can use the CONFIG= ToolType to keep separate configurations files for different AWeb versions. By default this alpha is set to use a configuration called 'AWeb36a3'.</li>
		<li><b>OS4 compatibility</b> This is a 68k build, that does run on OS4, but with even more issues (see below)</li>
		<li>This release is built optimised for 68020 processors. It is possible to build a 68000 compatible build from the project source</li>
		<li>Similarly the PNG, JFIF (JPEG) and GIF plugins are built for 68020 with 68881 FPU but can be built for other targets</li>
		<li>The PNG plugin is not recommended for use - it is much slower than any PNG DataType, and causes deadlocks with PNG assets delivered over HTTPS</li>
		<li>GIF and JPEG plugins are only recommended if you need the AnimGIF or alpha channel features. Again, the DataTypes for whichever version of Amiga you use are almost certainly faster</li>
		<li>None of the AWebPlugins are configured to be used by default due to the reasons noted above</li>
        <li>This Alpha build of AWeb saves it's disk cache in the T: location - this helps ensure it won't corrupt your hard disk, but means it uses more RAM, and prevents collision with other versions of AWeb you may have installed</li>
        <li>AWeb needs Fast RAM, hopefully in 2025 every Amiga user has plenty of Fast RAM</li>
        <li>No need to run any installer script, just put this drawer wherever you want, and run AWeb from here, it will assign AWeb: to the current directory if it does not exist already</li>
        <li>Multiple icons including the original GlowIcons set by Oliver Tacke and Thomas Peterseim, the MasonIcons version and the MagicWB version. You can also find icons for AWeb in collections such as the AmigaOS 3.2 GlowIcons collection</li>
        <li>As with all versions of AWeb, you need ReAction to run AWeb (it may work with ClassAct but is not tested), a bsdsocket.library compatible TCP/IP stack, as well as AmiSSL 5 if you want to use HTTPS connections</li>
        <li>A default toolbar button "Protoweb" will configure use of the Protoweb.org proxy which lets you browse the web as if it's 1999! To turn this off, open the Network settings and set the HTTP Proxy to blank ("").</li>
    </ul>
    
</p>

<p>
    New features in AWeb 3.6 include:
<ul>
<li><b>CSS</b> - AWeb now supports CSS, starting with experimental inline CSS for properties matching HTML4 attributes and even more experimental support for external CSS stylesheets</li>
<li>Introducing <b>AWebView</b> - a new standalone HTML and Markdown file viewer, built from the same shared AWeb codebase</li></li>
<li><b>Web safe fonts</b> - Font tag parsing and matching logic now works like other browsers</li>
<li>The new gemini.aweblib module brings <b>gemini://</b> and <b>spartan://</b> protocol support for these new gopher-like networks</li>
<li>A new about.aweblib brings <b>about:</b> URLs with home, fonts, version, plugins and blank page templates</li>
<li>AWeb now knows how to handle <b>view-source:</b> allowing you to view any URL as plain text HTML source</li>
<li>Directory browsing is now possible with the file:// protocol, and you can browse the root file:/// to see all mounted volumes</li>
<li><b>Markdown</b> - AWeb now understands and renders Markdown as rich text, with on the fly conversion to HTML</li>
<li><b>HTTP/1.1</b> gzip and chunked encoding, Range (RFC 7233) support for fast automatic transer resume, and experimental keep-alive support (not enabled yet in this release)</li>
<li><b>AmiSSL 5.25</b> support for HTTPS connections, including TLS 1.3 and strong cipher suites</li>
<li><b>data:</b> URL support allows for inline binary attachments</li>
<li><b>utf-8</b> transcoding of the most common multibyte characters to Latin-1</li>
<li><b>AmigaOS 3.2</b> features such as contextual mouse pointers, DefIcons and window iconification are now supported, while retaining compatibility with 3.1</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>What is AWebView?</h2>
<p>
AWebView is a new standalone HTML and Markdown file viewer (in fact, it can display any file AWeb can display including images) built from the same AWeb codebase using the LOCALONLY build configuration. It is a separate application from AWeb and takes up (slightly) less RAM because it does not integrate any of the network features.
</p>

<p>AWebView incorporates the same file:// protocol handler as AWeb including the new directory browsing feature added in AWeb 3.6.</p>

<p>AWebView loads it's preferences from an AWeb profile called 'AWebView' instead of the default AWeb config. AWebCfg can still be used to edit the preferences for AWebView, by saving the preferences . Of course, many of the preference settings are not relevant to AWebView and will be ignored.</p>

<h3>What's the plan for AWebView?</h3>

This is an initial release of AWebView provided as a proof of concept for feedback purposes. Some ideas about how AWebView may or may not be developed further include:
<ul>
<li>A more simple toolbar area, or perhaps even no toolbar at all!</li>
<li>Pared back menu options and more generally stripping out features that are not relevant to a standalone file viewer in order to reduce the binary size</li>
<li>More command line arguments, offering similar options to MultiView</li>
<li>File manager operations, and Workbench integration where it makes sense, probably using the existing ARexx integration
<li>Support for launching Tools directly from AWebView as if launched from Workbench (again, probably via ARexx integration)</li>
<li>Note that AWebView already inherits AWeb's AppWindow support. Currently this will view the file, not copy it to the location of the current folder as might be expected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running AWeb</h2>

<p>
AWeb no longer requires an installer script. It can run from anywhere. Just run it from the folder it's in. Do note however that if the assign "AWeb:" does not already exist it will temporarily assign it to its current directory until it exits. On the other hand if you have assigned AWeb: to a different location then it won't find its plugins.
</p>
<p>
When launched from Workbench, the default CONFIG is set to AWeb36a3 in the ToolTypes, which means it will not conflict with any existing AWeb prefs in your ENV:AWeb3 directory. When running from the command line you must specify CONFIG=AWeb36a3 to achieve the same effect as it will otherwise use the existing AWeb prefs. If you have an earlier version of AWeb installed with saved settings, this will prevent AWeb from using those settings which may include deprecated default paths such as AWebPath:
</p>
<p>
This alpha build supports a HTTPDEBUG/S command line option which will output a LOT of debugging output to the console for any network operations. If you use this, redirect the output to a file on a safe disk like the RAM: disk or, if running under emulation, a mounted host folder, just in case it causes filesystem corruption.
</p>
<p>
The requirements for AWeb 3.6 remain the same as the original 3.4 release, however most websites, even those that only use HTML 3 and 4 features, require significant amounts of RAM - 8MB Fast RAM is probably a sensible minimum. Some of the new default settings assume a more powerful Amiga than would have been common in the 1990s. It will of course fail to work with any modern website requiring HTML5, CSS3, video content,heavy JavaScript, etc. 
</p>

<h2> What's New in 3.6 Alpha 7?</h2>
<ul>
<li>DataType images now render with transparency if picture.datatype is v47 or higher, where also supported by the DataType in question</li>
<li>Experimental fixes for CSS merge race conditions courtesy of contributor 'cyberman'</li>
<li>AWeb no longer renders a placeholder image and border if an IMG element source is missing</li>
<li>Improved viewport width sizing algorithm with parsing of viewport meta tag to use as page width hint</li>
<li>Experimental modern toolbar layout removes the clutter of the old toolbar and replaces it with a more minimalist design. In this mode, the Reload button also functions as Stop</li>
<li>New HTML elements added including <b>SPAN</b> and <b>MARQUEE</b></li>
<li>New CSS styles added including...</li>
<li>And announcing, for the first time in an Amiga web browser, support for the <b>XMLHttpRequest</b> API and AJAX websites</li>
<li>AWeb is now a commodity, and can be managed by Exchange, with Show/Hide mapped to the Iconify feature</li>
<li>and AWeb now utilises the screen title to display relevant information such as available memory</li>
<li>Experimental <b>ttengine.library</b> support means AWeb can now natively support <b>TrueType/OpenType</b> fonts, with anti aliasing on full color screenmodes. ttengine.library is used automatically if installed on the system</li>
<li>FTP module now supports FTPS i.e. FTP over TLS. Note this is not the same as SFTP support, which would require a separate module</li>
<li>Removed PNG write functions from being built in to the PNG AWebPlugin, reducing the binary size back down to 140KB from over 180KB.</li>
<li>Rebuilt binaries with all relevant SAS/C optmisations turned on</li>
<li>BitMap allocations all now declare BMF_DISPLAYABLE to allow for hardware accelerated blitting with graphics cards</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Integrated the JavaScript engine from AWeb 3.5 bringing full JavaScript 1.5 (ECMAScript 3) support, including RegExp</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: The standalone AWebJS JavaScript runtime now makes it possible to send ARexx commands to host ports from scripts</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Background images no longer get corrupted on OS4 (and probably also on P96) by applying correct access to BitMap structures</li>
<li>FIXED: Table spacing where cellspacing was set to 0 would still be overridden by the default 2 pixel spacing</li>
<li>FIXED: Rendering bugs in the bgalign implementation reintegrated from AWeb 3.5</li>
<li>FIXED: AmiSSL 5.25 now works for HTTPS connections on OS4.</li>
<li>FIXED: Buttons activating ARexx scripts could sometimes cause an illegal instruction guru</li>
<li>FIXED: HTML and CSS string matching now uses utility.library Stricmp() directly instead of stricmp() for maximum performance</li>
<li>FIXED: Content-Length header should not be expected when chunked encoding is used</li>
</ul>

<h3> What's New in 3.6 Alpha 6?</h3>
<ul>
<li>More CSS properties are now supported, including padding, margin, position, top, left, right, bottom, border, vertical-align, text-align, and combined table cell styles</li>
<li>CSS colors can now be specified in either hex swatch format or by name</li>
<li>Connections that are still loading for the current page will immediately be terminated and a new connection will be made when navigating to a new page or reloading</li>
<li>That same improved connection cancellation now also applies to the Cancel All button in the Network Status window and the Cancel Load menu item and ARexx commands</li>
<li>AWeb now comes with an ARexx script for easily enabling the <b>Protoweb.org</b> proxy - browse the web as if it's 1999!</li>
<li>In order to support Multipart MIME in the future, AWeb now parses <b>cid:</b> and <b>data:</b> URL types for inline binary attachments</li>
<li>When viewing the directory view of the root file:/// it will show volume size and filesystem type rather than the normal directory listing</li>
<li>All binaries are now built with <b>68020</b> optimization enabled. If you need a different configuration, follow the build instructions in BUILD.md on GitHub</li>    
<li>All locale catalogs from AWeb 3.4 are now included in the distribution. Note that AWeb 3.6 currently uses the same catalogs as AWeb 3.4 with no additional strings added</li>
<li>ICO format images such as any <b>favicon.ico</b> are converted on the fly into regular BMP format images and then passed to DataTypes to render - this provides for an efficient way of supporting .ico without needing a full builtin decoder, given that .ico files are really only used for one purpose now</li>
<li><b>Mozilla bookmarks</b> files can now be imported into your AWeb Hotlist</li>
<li>Default <b>User-Agent</b> strings for spoofing now reflect a variety of real world browsers</li>
<li>AWeb no longer shows a 'FOUC' of a square image icon at the start of every page load</li>
<li><b>view-source:</b> in the URL bar is now supported, allowing you to view any URL as plain text (but note this does not work correctly with 30x redirects)</li>
<li>Added new default <b>MIME types</b> for files common in 2025, and set all MIME types to lowercase as specified in RFC 6838, although matching remains case-insensitive</li>
<li><b>HTTP Range</b> (RFC 7233) support added for fast automatic resume of incomplete requests, should mean fewer page assets failing to load</li>
<li>The PNG AWebPlugin has been updated to use <b>libpng 1.6.43</b> although it's still probably slower than whatever DataType you're using for PNG</li>
<li>Rebuilt with latest <b>AmiSSL 5.25</b> SDK</li>
<li>AWeb will now prefer <b>CHACHA20-POLY1305</b> ciphers over AES-GCM for better performance on Amiga - if you have an Amiga oriented website consider adding this to your server's TLS configuration for faster loading speed</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Reintegrated support for INS and DEL HTML elements</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: bgalign implementation</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Reintegrated the optimisation for background image redraws</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Missing FreeMem call in every AWebPlugin startup.c</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Fixed JavaScript Image onerror handling</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Some FORM elements like INPUT and BUTTON can now exist outside of forms and be used as document GUI objects that can trigger JavaScript events</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Saved files will get a DefIcons icon if its running on the system, thanks to using GetDiskObjectNew() instead of GetDefDiskObject()</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Fixed bug with nested tables having the height tag</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Fixed long standing bug with caching of javascript source files that would store empty files in cache</li>

<li>AWEB 3.5: The referer in redirected pages is now set correctly</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: AWeb is now aware that printer.device can handle bitmaps greater than 8 bits from version 44, enabling printing from deep screens without requiring Turboprint</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: In tolerant mode event handlers such as onclick now allow the form "javascript:code" often used and supported by other browsers</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Non RFC cookie mode extended to allow .domain.com to match domain.com, improving the behaviour of some login systems</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Added Copy Image Url To Clipboard to default Image Popup menu</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Fixed bug where Javascript images could overwrite some document properties</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Fixed bug where transparent GIF animations did not update their backgrounds</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Integrated fixes for known Enforcer hits in original AWeb 3.4 in body.c, defprefs.c and jcomp.c</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Added support for mousewheel scrolling on OS4</li>
<li>FIXED: Refactored SSL_CTX management</li>
<li>FIXED: XML character entity matching is case sensitive again</li>
<li>FIXED: Loading cached external CSS stylesheets would fail if server returned a 304 Not Modified response</li>
<li>FIXED: Redirects for URLs with query strings now work properly - they are marked as volatile to force refresh since query strings change the URL's intent</li>
<li>FIXED: If external CSS stylesheets were in utf-8 format, the parser would get stuck in an infinite loop</li>
<li>FIXED: Long standing bug from AWeb 3.4 where wrong struct member was used to reply to the WBStartup ReplyPort, which could cause unpredictable crashes on launch or DSI errors on OS4</li>
<li>FIXED: When Background images were turned off, the background color and body styles were also not applied</li>
<li>FIXED: BUTTON elements now render their inner text as their label instead of being blank or using the object's value property</li>
<li>FIXED: The GIF AWebPlugin now builds a working binary again that doesn't crash on initialization</li>
<li>FIXED: Fix Connection header parsing for comma-separated values, preventing reload failures and memory issues when servers request connection closure via comma-separated Connection headers.</li>
<li>FIXED: Table column width distribution for unsized columns and default border rendering when border attribute is not specified</li>
<li>FIXED: After integrating the AWeb 3.5 changes for bgalign, child elements no longer rendered their own backgrounds when there was a body background image
<li>FIXED: The ARexx RUN command for running ARexx scripts from menu items and buttons no longer risks a crash if the script does not exist</li>
<li>FIXED: Numerous stability improvements to the AmiSSL and CSS codebases, too many to list here</li>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's New in 3.6 Alpha 5?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experimental <b>inline CSS</b> support for a subset of CSS1 and CSS2 properties, see the <a href="Docs/css_test.html">inline CSS Test Page</a></li>
<li>Experimental <b>link rel="stylesheet"</b> support for external CSS stylesheets, see the <a href="Docs/stylesheet_test.html">link rel=stylesheet Test Page</a></li>
<li>IMPORTANT: Some websites that were previously usable with earlier releases of AWeb may no longer display in a usable form, if they use external stylesheets</li>
<li><b>XHTML 1.0</b> support for parsing and rendering XHTML documents, enforcing strict parsing mode when XHTML is detected and supporting CDATA</li>
<li>PNG AWebPlugin updated further to version 1.0.69 (latest 1.0.x branch) after it was updated to 1.0.0 by integrating the changes from AWeb 3.5</li>
<li>Experimental support for the <b>gemini://</b> and <b>spartan://</b> protocols, new gopher-like networks, and the gemtext markup language they use</li>
<li>Introducing <b>AWebView</b> a new standalone HTML and Markdown file viewer built using the LOCALONLY build configuration</li>
<li>utf-8 support now handles mapping some 3-byte and 4-byte characters to Latin-1</li>
<li>TLS connections now safely fail immediately instead of prompting the user to allow unsecure fallback, if secure socket cannot be established</li>
<li>PNG AWebPlugin now uses the same zlib as the main AWeb program instead of the previous ancient version</li>
<li>Further enhancement to the <b>HTTP/1.1 keep-alive</b> support but still disabled in this alpha release build</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: PNG AWebPlugin's libpng library updated to version 1.0.0 as used in AWeb 3.5</li> 
<li>AWEB 3.5: JFIF AWebPlugin's JPEG library updated to version 6b as used in AWeb 3.5</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: GIF AWebPlugin incorporates GIF engine changes from AWeb 3.5</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Reintegrated the improvements to the gopher:// aweblib module</li>
<li>FIXED: Null pointer access during argument parsing on launch which failed silently except on OS4 where it throws a DSI error</li>
<li>FIXED: If using a custom CONFIG argument, AWeb now creates the directory for it if it doesn't already exist before saving into it</li>
<li>FIXED: TLS connections are properly cleaned up in all circumstances and AmiSSL libraries are only closed on application exit</li>
<li>FIXED: Improvements to chunked encoding handling mean connections to google no longer trigger binary download. Google still doesn't work but at least you'll see their errors pages now</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's New in 3.6 Alpha 4?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Experimental HTTP/1.1 keep-alive support has been added to the codebase but is not enabled in this build as it requires further testing, and appears to be slower not faster as expected</li>
<li>HTTPS connections now deny use of weak ciphers and TLS versions below 1.2 and also check CN and SAN name matches, with wildcard support, chain validation and Server Name Indication (SNI)</li>
<li>FONT tags now search first for the named font if it exists on the system, then for the mapped alternative, then for the fallback font for the requested family</li>
<li>The new <a href="about:fonts">about:fonts</a> page now illustrates exactly how AWeb will render the defacto standard web safe fonts on your system with the fonts you have installed</li>
<li>about.aweblib module now includes <a href="about:plugins">about:plugins</a> which will list all loaded AWebPlugin and AWebLib modules</li>
<li>theoldnet.com is now a default bookmark and the proxy function has been tested with theoldnet.com's http proxy service for browsing old versions of websites</li>
<li>To use theoldnet.com proxy, enter "http://theoldnet.com:1996" as the proxy host and port in the Network settings, and set web.archive.org as an exception</li>
<li>FORM elements such as INPUT, TEXTAREA, SELECT and BUTTON now render using the current font of the element they are contained within, rather than the system font</li>
<li>URL parameters passed on the command line with no URL protocol are assumed to be local files, or in other words to open local files it is no longer necessary to specify the file:// protocol (actually this was added in 3.6 Alpha 2 but missed from these Release Notes)</li>
<li>The file:// protocol now supports browsing and navigating directories as well as viewing files unless a file "index.html" is present in the directory. From here you can view individual files and navigate into subdirectories.</li>
<li>Additionally, if you navigate to the <a href="file:///">file:///</a> root URL you will see a list of all mounted volumes</li>
<li>Added new command line option (and corresponding ToolType) "NOSTARTUP/S". If this is passed, the startup.aweblib plugin will not be run even if it exists and therefore no splash screen will show.</li>
<li>The Documentation now includes test pages for HTML3.2, HTML4.0 and JavaScript 1.1 to make it easy to see exactly how AWeb handles these standards</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: JavaScript now employs dynamic garbage collection during script execution instead of only at the end, reducing overall memory usage</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Implemented ETags for caching</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Implemented Content-Disposition parsing used for setting suggested name for file downloads</li>
<li>AWEB 3.5: Reintegrated support for 302 and 307 redirects</li>
<li>FIXED: Entities are now always rendered as actual characters regardless of the HTML compatibility mode</li>
<li>FIXED: Proxy settings are now actually saved - this was completely missing in the original AWeb 3.4 source code</li>
<li>FIXED: Broken ReadBytes function in the PNG plugin could cause an infinite loop loading assets from HTTPS connections, now fixed following the JPEG version pattern.</li>
</ul>


<h3>What's New in 3.6 Alpha 3?</h3>
<ul>
<li>On larger screen resolutions (above 640x512) new browser windows will default to a more sensible size rather than full screen</li>
<li>Closing the last browser window from the close gadget will no longer prompt with an 'Are you sure you want to quit?' requester unless there are transfers still in progress</li>
<li>AWeb will now use system provided <b>contextual mouse pointers</b> if intuition.library v47 or greater is available, instead of its own custom pointers, for links, text cursors, popup menus and resize handles</li>
<li>Implemented better content type detection for text formats and image formats from web servers that send unknown or octet-stream content type headers, which should reduce the likelihood of being forced to save a file the browser should be able to render</li>
<li>HAIKU/S is now a valid alternative to the VVIIV/S (5-7-5.. get it?) command line option "easter egg"</li>
<li>All remaining Latin-1 XML entities are now supported</li>
<li><b>Markdown</b> documents loaded both from files or http(s) URLs are rendered as HTML on the fly</li>
<li><b>about:</b> URL protocol now provides a <a href="about:home">default home page</a>, an <a href="about:blank">about:blank</a>, a <a href="about:fonts">fonts test page</a>, and a <a href="about:version">version information page</a></li>
<li>Added a default custom config name (AWeb36a3) to the AWeb icon when launching from Workbench in order to avoid conflict with any preexisting AWeb settings in your ENV:AWeb3 directory</li>
<li>TLS/SSL connections are now much more secure by default - rejecting anything other than TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 and only using strong ciphers</li>
<li>HTTPS connections now properly verify that the hostname matches the certificate following RFC 6125</li>
<li>FIXED: Removed an unnecessary additional init SSL function call which may have caused some instability with HTTPS connections</li>
<li>FIXED: AWeb really will automatically create the AWeb: assign now if it doesn't already exist, and remove it on exit if it created it. This was broken in 3.6 Alpha 2</li>
<li>FIXED: Large files are sometimes truncated due to chunk buffers being too small</li>
</ul>

<h3>What's New in 3.6 Alpha 2?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Migrated from ClassAct to ReAction</li>
<li>Refactored to use P96 instead of Cybergraphics</li>
<li>SSL rewritten to use AmiSSL v5.2</li>
<li>Updated to build against NDK3.2 and ToolKit SDK</li>
<li>Renamed executable from 'AWeb-II' to simply 'AWeb'</li>
<li>HTTP module completely written to use HTTP/1.1, gzip and chunked encodings</li>
<li>Socket connections can be arbitrarily terminated at any time and now timeout after 15 seconds of inactivity</li>
<li>Default background color for HTML rendering changed to white</li>
<li>Images no longer render a border when associated with an a link</li>
<li>Default search engine changed to BoingSearch.com</li>
<li>Cookies now accepted by default, avoiding requester overload</li>
<li>Default fonts changed to use the Amiga's default scalable fonts</li>
<li>Added web-safe font aliases for better font matching</li>
<li>Added XML character entities support</li>
<li>Added stopgap UTF-8 conversion to prevent spurious glyphs</li>
<li>Updated default bookmarks and default search engine is now boingsearch.com</li>
<li>INet225 support removed - use bsdsocket.library instead</li>
<li>MiamiSSL support removed - use AmiSSL 5.20+ instead</li>
<li>CyberGraphX support removed (for now anyway) - this build uses P96 instead which should make it more viable under emulation and on OS4</li>
<li>Builds again with SAS/C! Does not require gcc, native or cross-compiler to build</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues in 3.6 Alpha 7</h2>
<ul>
<li>Setting the disk cache to 0 or a very small size will prevent images from rendering - this is an issue carried over from the original AWeb</li>
<li>The new CSS functionality has race conditions that may cause CSS styles not to be applied on faster Amigas (especially emulated ones) when pages are loaded from cache</li>
<li>The documentation is still being updated for release 3.6</li>
<li>The new support for Markdown documents still has some visual glitches</li>
<li>The AWebPlugins are deliberately not enabled by default, you will need to enable them manually in the configuration - however the plugins offer little to no benefit compared to using recent DataTypes, which tend to be much faster</li>
<li>Feedback is also particularly welcome on default settings and default programs</li>
<li>JavaScript has many issues which are being addressed by integrating the AWeb 3.5 codebase, which is still work in progress</li>
<li>When using ttengine.library layout is not always correct and text may overlap or render incorrectly</li>
</ul>

<h3>Known Issues with OS4</h3>
